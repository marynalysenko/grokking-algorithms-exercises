# grokking-algorithms-exercises
This repository is a personal project developed as part of my journey through the book "Grokking Algorithms." As a reader of the book, I've taken it upon myself to practically implement and try out the algorithms and exercises presented, using Python as the programming language. The repository contains my solutions to the activities, example codes, and additional notes and comments that I've made to deepen my understanding of the material. The comments are provided in both Ukrainian and English languages.

### Features
- **Python Implementations**: Practical implementation of algorithms and data structures presented in the book using Python.
- **Bilingual Comments**: Each line of code is accompanied by explanations in both Ukrainian and English.
- **Personal Notes**: Additional notes and reflections on each algorithm or exercise to enhance comprehension.
- **Exercise Solutions**: Practical application of the exercises and tasks given in the book.

### How to Use the Repository
The repository is organized according to the chapters or topics of the book. Each folder represents a specific chapter or theme. You can view the solutions and examples by opening the attached folder. The repository is open for cloning and local use.

### Message to Readers
If you have questions, suggestions, or ideas for improving the repository, please feel free to open an Issue or send me a message. I value feedback and interaction with other algorithm enthusiasts.
